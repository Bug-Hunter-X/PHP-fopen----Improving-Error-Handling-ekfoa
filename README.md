# PHP fopen() Error Handling Improvement

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP file handling using `fopen()` and provides a more robust solution.

The original code only checks for a false return value from `fopen()`, which doesn't provide specific error details. The improved solution uses `ferror()` to get detailed error information and provides more context-specific error messages.

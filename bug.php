```php
$file = fopen('myfile.txt', 'r');
if ($file) {
    // Process the file
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error
    echo "Error opening file.";
}
```
This code has a potential issue: It only checks if the `fopen` function returned a valid file handle. However, `fopen` can fail for various reasons other than the file not existing (e.g., insufficient permissions, incorrect file path, etc.).  The error message is generic, making debugging difficult.
